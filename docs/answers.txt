Date of GitLab tutorials completion: October 8, 2020
Date when GitHub account was set up: I have had this account for quite a while. I'd estimate that I created the account sometime in late 2018.

2. There have been 9 commits so far. Command used: git rev-list --count HEAD

3. The README file was last modified: Thu Oct 8 19:43:21 2020 -0400. The command I used to get this info: git log 

4. Branches are used to point to a specific commit, and also to separate different projects so that it is easier to push out only finished projects.

5. Git log displays a list of the project history and allows you to filter results and search for specific changes. Git status lets you inspect the
	working directory. Git log only operated on the committed history.

6. git log Vehicle.h

7. git log --grep="file"  

8. I) Inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation.
   II) Polymorphism is the concept that refers to the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms.
   III) Encapsulation is the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.

9. The Dictator & Lieutenants workflow is based upon the concept of having a hierarchy of various integration managers that are in charge of certain
	parts of the repository.
   The Integration-Manager workflow allows developers to have write access to their own public repositories that represent the official project. In this workflow,
	developers must send a request to the maintainer ofthe main project to pull in their changes.

10. A team of 100 developers would benefit from using the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow because it is generally used by huge projects with hundreds of collaborators.
	This workflow benefits largs projects because it allows the project leader (dictator) to delegate much of the work and collect large subsets of code  at
	multiple points before integrating them.
